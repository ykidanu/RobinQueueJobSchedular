RATCH asks for user input and based on input creates programs and adds them to a job scheduler 
and runs them till the scheduler finishes.  
Type make into the prompt to compile and run the program. 
My code uses C++11 syntax in some locations which is i modified the make file to use it on rucs. 
On my Linux box it does not require the modified make file. 
the goal of RATCH is to make a job scheduler that implements the robin queue algorithm
